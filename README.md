# demo-spring-vite-vue3
Demo project for Spring Boot as backend for Vite + Vue 3

This is a very small [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) project (only three Java classes)
which integrates a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Javascript frontend (using a build setup based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
into its build process.
